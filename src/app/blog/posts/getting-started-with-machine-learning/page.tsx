                      <ListItem>that you don't know much about Python but aren't too unfamiliar with programming languages. If you know some Python, awesome. If you're an expert, even better. If you know another programming language, that'll help a lot! You more or less know where you fit here so move forward accordingly; let's assume that you are a beginner in Python (or programming in general).</ListItem>

                  <Text>There's no particular order to this, and the resources I suggest could be subjective. As a learner, you're free to roam around, but having some basic foundation when it comes to math & programming (Python) is key.</Text>
